### export and export.default()

Using the `export` requires you to import using braces `{ variable }` so the variable can't change its name when importing
unlike `export default` which allow you to change it since is just the `varaible`

- Creating elements with out typical `.jsx` is a mess.
  Example: To create, an element with the JSX syntax, you'd have to do

```javascript
React.createElement(div, { id: "container" }, "hello jerry");
```

#### without JSX

```javascript
import React from "react";

export const CardWithoutJsx = () => {
  return React.createElement(
    "div",
    { id: "card" },
    React.createElement("h2", null, "Welcome"),
    React.createElement("p", null, "This is a paragraph with text"),
    React.createElement("button", null, "without JSX"),
  );
};
```

### JSX rules

- All jsx code must closed. we can't have

```javascript
<input type="email">
```

The correct way is

```javascript
<input type="email" />
```
